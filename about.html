        <p>"Comfortable makes you good, but we're trying to be unstoppable and there are prices to pay for it" - Tim
            Grover</p>
        <p><mark></mark>I always was a person who wanted to be great at the things I do. The great sports figures I
            watched when I
            was younger presented me an idea of
            competitiveness, drive, discipline, passion, for the game, okay it was one player and his name is Kevin
            Garnett.
            The passion and work ethic he had for the game really inspired me to replicate the same work to what I
            wanted to do.
            The problem was I never knew what I wanted to do, and all the focus and drive went to naught. Fortunely I
            believe I found
            where I can focus that energy and drive in Web design and Software development and become one of the greats
            in.
